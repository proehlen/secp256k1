# secp256k1
Experimental implementation of converting sec256k1 private key to public key.  Adapated from YouTube video "[Blockchain tutorial 11: Elliptic Curve key pair generation](https://youtu.be/wpLQZhqdPaA)" and accompanying Python source code.  Any errors are no doubt mine and not the video creator's.

**Warning** This code was written for my own educational purposes only.
